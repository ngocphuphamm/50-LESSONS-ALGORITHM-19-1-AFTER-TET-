Sure, let's say we have a 2D array called "board" with the following values:

{ {'5', '3', '.', '.', '7', '.', '.', '.', '.'},
{'6', '.', '.', '1', '9', '5', '.', '.', '.'},
{'.', '9', '8', '.', '.', '.', '.', '6', '.'},
{'8', '.', '.', '.', '6', '.', '.', '.', '3'},
{'4', '.', '.', '8', '.', '3', '.', '.', '1'},
{'7', '.', '.', '.', '2', '.', '.', '.', '6'},
{'.', '6', '.', '.', '.', '.', '2', '8', '.'},
{'.', '.', '.', '4', '1', '9', '.', '.', '5'},
{'.', '.', '.', '.', '8', '.', '.', '7', '9'} }

The outer for loop will iterate through each row from 0 to 8, and the inner for loop will iterate through each column from 0 to 8.

On the first iteration (i=0, j=0), the code will check the value of board[0][0], which is '5'. Since it is not '.', the code will create a string "b" with the value "(5)". It will then add the value of "b + i" which is "(5)0" to the HashSet "seen". it will add the value of "j + b" which is "0(5)" to the HashSet "seen". it will add the value of "i/3 + b + j/3" which is "0(5)0" to the HashSet "seen".
On the next iteration (i=0, j=1), the code will check the value of board[0][1], which is '3'. And the process will continue.

If at any point the code tries to add a value that has already been added to the HashSet, the add method will return false, and the function will return false, indicating that the board is not a valid Sudoku puzzle.

After all the cells have been checked, if none of the add operations returned false, that means the board is a valid Sudoku puzzle, and the function will return true.

continue let's simulate the data detail 
Sure, continuing with our example:

On the first iteration (i=0, j=0), the code will check the value of board[0][0], which is '5'. Since it is not '.', the code will create a string "b" with the value "(5)". It will then add the value of "b + i" which is "(5)0" to the HashSet "seen". it will add the value of "j + b" which is "0(5)" to the HashSet "seen". it will add the value of "i/3 + b + j/3" which is "0(5)0" to the HashSet "seen".

On the next iteration (i=0, j=1), the code will check the value of board[0][1], which is '3'. It will create a string "b" with the value "(3)". it will add the value of "b + i" which is "(3)0" to the HashSet "seen". it will add the value of "j + b" which is "1(3)" to the HashSet "seen". it will add the value of "i/3 + b + j/3" which is "0(3)0" to the HashSet "seen".

On the next iteration (i=0, j=2), the code will check the value of board[0][2], which is '.'. Since it is '.', the code will skip this iteration.

On the next iteration (i=0, j=3), the code will check the value of board[0][3], which is '.'. Since it is '.', the code will skip this iteration.

And so on, the code will iterate through all the cells in the 2D array and check for the validation of Sudoku puzzle.

If the code encounters any cell with a value that has already been added to the HashSet, the add method will return false, and the function will return false, indicating that the board is not a valid Sudoku puzzle.

If all the cells have been checked and none of the add operations returned false, that means the board is a valid Sudoku puzzle, and the function will return true.

In this example, since the input is a valid sudoku puzzle, so the function would return true.

Sure, continuing with our example:

And so on, the code will iterate through all the cells in the 2D array, for each iteration it will check for the validation of Sudoku puzzle, if the code encounters any cell with a value that has already been added to the HashSet, the add method will return false, and the function will return false, indicating that the board is not a valid Sudoku puzzle.
If all the cells have been checked and none of the add operations returned false, that means the board is a valid Sudoku puzzle, and the function will return true.
